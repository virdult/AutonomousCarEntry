Brief descriptions and content for the weekly projects and assignments are listed below:
- Week 0: This project is designed to teach advanced C++ programming through the simulation of a space agency and mission management system. It emphasizes the use of classes, inheritance, and encapsulation to model entities like Agency, Mission, Passenger, Astronaut, and Person. Learners gain experience in object-oriented design, modular code organization, and user interaction via the terminal, while implementing features such as mission execution, success/failure probability, profit calculation, and ticket management. The project also demonstrates dynamic container management with STL vectors, input validation, and error handling, as well as the use of static class members, polymorphism, and method overriding. Additionally, it introduces practical C++ software development practices, including header/source separation, clear getter/setter conventions, and structuring code for building with CMake, providing a strong foundation for larger-scale simulations and collaborative projects.
  
- Week 1:
  
- Week 2: This project is designed to strengthen intermediate to advanced C++ programming skills through the creation of a structured menu recommendation system. It emphasizes the use of classes, structs, and namespaces to encapsulate data and functionality, as well as file I/O for reading and processing JSON-formatted menu data. Learners will implement algorithms for sorting, filtering, and recommending items based on user input and preferences, practicing object-oriented design, modular code organization, and error handling. The project also covers the integration of third-party libraries (like nlohmann/json) and encourages best practices in code readability, maintainability, and building with CMake, providing a foundation for collaborative development and version control using GitHub. Users will interact with the system through the terminal, gaining experience in user input validation, program flow control, and simple recommendation logic.
